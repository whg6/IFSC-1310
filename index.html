            <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
            <p>
                Progressive Enhancement is a development methodology where the focus is on content and constructing a strong base that works on older/more limited versions of browsers/devices. After that baseline is built more advanced features are added in layers for polish and added functionality for devices that can handle them. 
            </p>
            <p>The advantages of progressive enhancement as opposed to something like graceful degradation is better compatibility with search engines (they can identify content better), easier testing in development, and wider reach of compatible devices and methods of viewing the content.

            <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
            <p>
             Looking at the final product of this website really emphasizes just how much I&#39;ve learned since the start of this semester. I came into this class with only an extremely rudimentary understanding of HTML from a junior high class I took over a decade ago. Needless to say I didn&#39;t recall much at all from that and basically was starting from scratch. I really enjoyed how &quot;hands-on&quot; the class was and the practical industry tips sprinkled in the lessons were also great nuggets of wisdom to pick up on.   
            </p>
            <p>Though I was learning a lot certain things did come easier than others. The language itself, the logic behind it, and how it was structured were elements that I picked up relatively easily, largely in part due to prior experience working with C++. However, some things like designing an optimal layout, troubleshooting issues, as well as a tendency to sometimes bite off more than I could chew, I struggled a bit more with. Coming up with something that is both functional as well as aesthetically pleasing is no small task and I spent a decent time just trying to come up with things that would fit this bill as opposed to just creating them. Troubleshooting is something I still struggle with in other programming languages, which I think in large part is probably lack of experience and familiarity with the tools at my disposal. I just learned the other day how much &quotInspect&quot on a website could help in this process for example.</p>
            <p>
             During this Dragon project specifically I learned a lot about what the general workflow works like when working on a project. From looking at requests from clients and drawing up sketches of what I would like the structure of the website to look like, to having to do outside research to make some of these ideas work. I learned some obvious things like how to build things like an interactive slideshow and drop down list, which had me looking at some outside resources on javascript. I also got some experience working with a preexisting code base and how making changes to things can have further reaching effects than you expect. Really got some practice in identifying where conflicts would occur, how important appropriate class labels can be, and making new elements fit in with existing ones in a website.

             I received some good feedback from both Professor Wallace as well as my brother who gave me a good neutral third-party perspective on my website. First big mistake I made was forgetting to validate my pages, where I had missed some errors. It was pointed out to me I had some orphaned sections of code, as well as a bad habit of including inline css in a few places. Luckily all relatively quick fixes.    
            </p>
            <p>
             My brother&#39;s feedback was more centered around the content and presentation of the website itself. Aside from some spelling errors located in the &quot;Overview&quot; paragraphs, he wanted to tweak the font size of the text in that same section to something a bit larger. He also suggested changing the name from &quot;Overview&quot; to &quot;Specifications&quot; because he believed it was a more appropriate fit for the content it contained. He also had a couple of good incites about the History page as well. The first was the white space on the page was too large and recommended reducing it to be more in-line with that of the homepage. In order to fix this I decided to add an extra background image, with a small quote from Elon Musk that I felt embodied the mission of SpaceX well. His second insight was aimed at the table in recent history and was something that never crossed my mind. The original table when hovering over the different rows each would highlight, an attempt to better increase readability on my part. The problem with this he said was that this caused him to think that there was some interactivity involved with the table and attempt to click on it. This could lead to a user looking for something that doesn&#39;t exist or feel that something wasn&#39;t working. At his recommendation, I removed the hover function on the table to increase clarity.
